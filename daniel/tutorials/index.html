<p >The more tutorials in the world, the better! So long as everyone who makes them does their due diligence in ensuring correctness and understandability. Tutorials I write will be collected here over time. For starters, a <a href="#/tutorials/math">math tutorial</a>. Additionally, I will link to tutorials I've found elsewhere, such as <a href="">this</a> excellent one for learning SDL.</p>
