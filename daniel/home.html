<h1>Minetest Raidcraft modpack port under consideration</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.minetest.net/">Minetest</a> is an LGPL alternative to Minecraft written in C++, which already has a solid mod api and mod downloader. This makes Minetest a very attractive target for porting Kingsquee's Raidcraft mod pack, since Raidcraft can no longer be updated for Minecraft. Raidcraft is an experience distinct from other modpacks as it forces the player to act boldly early on, and pressures the player to raid difficult dungeons just to have sufficient supplies to survive. It is a fantastical hunter-gatherer simulation, which also takes into account invasion by Mongol hordes. Suffice to say, it's a challenge on par with Dwarf Fortress, and worthy of being preserved in a new medium.</p>
<p>The full viability of Minetest for a Raidcraft port will be determined sometime around July of 2015, and if viable a preliminary build will be released about that time.</p>

<h1>Researching Technology for Liberty</h1>
<p>My foremost goal in life is to reduce recurring <em>monetary</em> costs as much as possible, so that I can spend more of my life writing, reading, and researching with people that I get along with. I've identified three areas of focus: <a ng-href="{{url_boatdev}}">Housing Costs</a>, <a ng-href="{{url_autoagro}}">Food Costs</a>, and <a ng-href="{{url_libreware}}">Information Costs</a>. To seriously advance on these fronts requires sorting through an enormous amount of information, and even the amount I've already gathered is not yet well organized. If you have any research you feel would be useful to these projects, or suggestions that you think may help, please consider sending Daniel an <a href="mailto:dtadeuszow@gmail.com">email</a>, a message on <a href="{{url_irc}}">IRC</a>, or modifying the website yourself and making a 'pull request' on <a href="https://github.com/Xenmen/Tadeuszow-site">github</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, please consider reading/watching some of the linked content below. <a href="http://www.stager.org/articles/twentythings.pdf">Here</a> is a very fascinating research document from the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, circa 1971, on the topic of computers and education, and <a href="http://www.chonday.com/Videos/1wtiterautomaton.mp4">here</a> is a video on an automaton built in 1770 that could write letters with a fountain pen. Without a doubt, any person could create something amazing, if only they all had the time, means and education.</p>
