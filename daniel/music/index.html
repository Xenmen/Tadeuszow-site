<p>Sporadically, I do things involving music or general audio. I have mixtapes at <a href="http://www.mixcloud.com/daniel-tadeuszow/">Mixcloud</a>, and songs I've made a <a href="https://xenmen.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> page, as Xenmen. I'm presently more interested in recreating old electronic music than creating original works, and remixing the entire Perfect Dark N64 soundtrack is a life goal (presently, 4 tracks have been midimapped and are in varying stages of arrangement).</p>
<p><a href="#/music/ableton">Ableton</a> is my DAW of choice.</p>
<p>If you use Linux as your primary workstation, I have good news for you! There are plenty more options than there used to be. I find Bitwig to be an exceptionally well engineered tool, though it is <em>not</em> freedom respecting. Take a look at this list for some <a href="http://www.techdrivein.com/2014/02/10-music-production-tools-for-ubuntu-linux.html">options</a>.</p>
<p>If you are in need of acoustic foam, I would recommend <a href="http://www.foambymail.com/acoustical-foam-products.html">Foam By Mail</a>.</p>

<p>Music history is well worth your time to study. There is much to learn from the experiments of the ancients, as well as more recent periods such as the European Rennaissance and the electronic instrument revolution.</p>
