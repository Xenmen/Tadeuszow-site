		<p >Presently, the most usable, reliable software I could find for both making music and performing as a DJ has been Ableton Live. There are two key UI elements that attracted me to Ableton from FL Studio. The first, and most serious, is that in FL Studio, when you close a piano roll window, it reverts to a default zoom level. I need to switch back and forth between moledies frequently the way I mix, so this created an absurd amount of extra work for me, constantly having to zoom out again to find my place. The second thing is that Ableton allows you to drag the edge of a clip horizontally to make it loop. FL Studio requires you to copy/paste the loop for as  many times as you want it to run. There are various other aspects to Ableton that I like, or that make it more appropriate for certain kinds of work. If you are having UX problems in whatever DAW software you are using, I would recommend Ableton. Only musicians working on special projects would have need of another DAW as of 2014.</p>
