<p >'Auto Agro' is short for 'Automated Agriculture', a catch-all nickname for automated foodproduction. Of all the major problems in the world today, most can be reduced to "people don't have the time to fix that". Why don't they have the time? Time to clean up waste in their area, to find recycling solutions, to create less waste in the first place, to learn about local and national laws, to learn about proper nutrition and better food sources, to get better education and better jobs, to live better lives? Often the answer is that "they're too busy of course, they need to work, they need to eat". That last item is key. There is a fear inherent in the current labour market, a fear of starvation (and homelessness) attached to job security. A person may not have the time to do anything, even look for a better job, because doing so might jeapordize their performance at work, endangering their job security, and thus risking starvation. (Many people in this position also manage their personal finances poorly; before criticizing that, remember they "don't have the time," they believe they really can't risk educating themselves on any subject that won't help them with their core fear, job security)</p>
<p >I propose that the best solution to these dilemnas (which really stem from survival fears), is to begin with generating food in an automated fashion, at the municpal level, and make staple foods a utility. A step further, I would propose synthetic food, such as Soylent, is the best pick; the process of creating artificial Soylent will be easy to verify, and can survive the hassles of government regulation. It is a nutritionally perfect solution (or will be, when enough additional research has been done), and eliminates the need for a citizen to 1.)research nutrition, and 2.)prepare food. This amounts to an enormous savings in time and mental tax (energy spent thinking), and is a step towards freeing citizens from a feudal power structure that takes advantage of and warps the human survival instinct to drive corporate profits.</p>

<p >Further information will be added here soon, along with updates as I unearth additional information. Until then, here are some raw links to existing projects demonstrating that automated food production, and synthetic food, are not only feasible but <em>have been implemented</em> already:</p>

<p>Also relevent is a piece by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimitar_Dobrev_%28academic%29#Main_theoretical_works">Dimitar Dobrev</a>, <cite>Structural problems of the automated agricultural industry</cite> (1945), which I am seeking a translation of.</p>
<p>An additional option is to directly synthesize soylent with arbitrary materials. Astonishingly, the basic idea is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8161128">well</a> <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/organic-synthesis-the-robo-chemist-1.15661">underway</a>.</p><br>
