<p><a href="http://www.prequeladventure.com/">Prequel Adventure</a> is a cute webcomic that takes place within the Elder Scrolls fiction, particularly the land of Skyrim. Many of the images are animated, and, best of all, there's a great deal of audience participation. Readers of the comic make suggestions as to what the characters should do next. Katia the Khajit (a race of feline humanoids in the Elder Scrolls games) is the main character.</p>
<p>While Prequel is a nice comic, I found I didn't like the 'web' aspect of its format. Scrolling up and down is not how I like to enjoy comics, especially comics like Prequel which have a standardized image size that matches common screen resolutions. Why? Because they're better suited as Visual Novels! This is where Python and Ren'Py come in...</p>
<p>Over a weekend, I wrote a Python script to crawl the Prequel comic, from start to finish, and record all the images, dialogue, and reader suggestions. Then, I had another script save all the images, and convert the text into a Ren'Py script. This catches everything in the comic, except for several multimedia and interactive pages of the comic, which are too complex to be converted automatically (there are at least 10 minigames over the course of the whole comic, and about as many slightly-interactive HTML5 animations).</p>
<p>Most special of all about the Visual Novel Edition, is that reader suggestions are hidden by default. This makes the comic read as if everything Katia and friends do was planned that way. Instead of seeing readers discuss what Katia should do, we instead see Katia as if she were debating internally what her next action should be. This makes the experience special enough that I believe it is worth sharing. That is why reader suggestions are hidden by default. They can be reenabled as of version 1.5, which will be released sometime this month, May of 2015.</p>
