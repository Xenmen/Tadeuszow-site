<p >"Silicon Quest" is the codename for a Libreware project to bring printed circuit fabrication closer to the general public. Digital computation is an extension of human thought, and the means of carrying out that computation are all manufactured and controlled by corporate entities. This situation is not condusive to a free society, and must not be allowed to persist. Information on solving this problem will be posted here as I sort through my past research, as I find more information, and as I acquire and build related equipment myself.</p>

<p>Homebrew printed circuitboards have already <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/14/squink-lets-you-print-a-circuit-board-for-the-price-of-a-cup-of-coffee/">passed</a> the threshhold, though cannot be said of <em>logic</em> components.</p>
<p>Solving the privacy issues in certificate handling is also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2nCVlRwOpw">in progress</a>.</p>
