				<p>My immediate projects are: <br>
				- this <a href="thissite.html">website</a><br>
				- writing a pip-installable scraper (currently finished DeviantArt & Newgrounds, yet to be uploaded to the pip database)<br>
				- automating the watering of several small herbs for tea, as my first sstep in <a href='autoagro.html'>Automated Agriculture</a><br>
				- BDT Music, a booru form website for music, where users upload youtube links instead of actual music files (to save bandwidth on my poor server, and to ensure creators are credited/paid through the existing google system)<br>
				- BDT Gaming, a news aggregator with integrity; all sources must be verified and reader-auditable, writers/submitters must disclose all personal ties with any persons involved in the projects reported<br>
				</p>
				
				<p >I've worked on a few interesting projects, and the one I'm most fond of is a series of Nintendo DS homebrew projects using <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/Automated%20Installer/">DevkitPro</a> (which includes LibNDS with the ARM compiler suite) and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nflib/">NFLib</a>.</p>
				<p >A series of misfortunes has left the projects in an unreleasable state, and when I have repaired my toolchain I will attempt to reconstruct them. A word of warning to anyone else who wants to make Nintendo DS homebrew; getting images of any sort into the project will be one of the hardest things you do, research it <em>thoroughly</em>. All guides and documentation on the subject is only partially complete. (When I succeed with automated agriculture, I will attempt to address this myself)</p>
				<p >My main longterm projects are this <a href="thissite.html">website</a>, understanding and assembling complex HTML5 applications, <a href='autoagro.html'>Automated Agriculture</a>, and <a href='libreware.html'>on-site computer circuit fabrication</a>.</p>
				<p>Some other long term projects under consideration are:</p>
				<p>* A privacy-oriented web browser, segregating user history/cookie/data across contexts, with a daemon storing strict rules for opening all links according to their contexts. (1. Firefox profiles as contexts and a firefox plugin working with the daemon, 2. PyQT browser with privacy respected by default) </p>
				<p>* A chat program that allows tagging of text and referencing of logs via those tags. Should be backwards compatible with IRC and xmpp.</p>
				<p>* Boatdev propaganda project, an activist simulator in Ren'Py.</p>
