			<p>'Boatdev' the nickname for a project to design and build a submersible houseboat, as one measure to address the housing crisis in coastal cities. Existing houseboats are often considered unsightly by the city's wealthier residents, who pressure local governments and law enforcement to disperse the houseboaters. Additionally, mooring/dock-fees are a persistent cost that erodes the inherent savings from purchasing and living on a houseboat. Boatdev aims to address all these issues with a houseboat that can submerge up to 20 feet below the surface.</p>
			<p>All current members of boatdev are technologists in the Canadian province of British Columbia. The team can be reached on the IRC network <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/">Freenode</a>, in the channel '#boatdev'.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Several general designs are under consideration, including a spheroid with an outer framework of rods (for modular extension and greater protection of the home itself, and structural stresses), a conventional cigar submarine (for greater locomotion in the area of residency, ), and a modified steel shipping crate (to reduce cost of construction, and the complexity of intercontinental moving, as trans-oceanic travel is not a planned ability of the first generation of boatdev).</p>
			<br>
			<p>It is rare for non-state/corporate entities to create and use submersible vehicles, but unheard of, and recent progress in China is very promising:</p>
			<p>Built by a laid off textile factory work, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2121216/Zhang-Wuyi-Unemployed-Chinese-man-builds-submarines-basement-31k-piece.html">read more</a></p>
			<p>Built by a retired police officer, <a href="http://beijingcream.com/2012/08/chinese-man-builds-homemade-submarine-sacred-dragon-2/">read more</a></p>
			<p>Others have attempted and failed. In all cases out of China, there exists a language barrier between the members of #boatdev and these Chinese innovators, although we would like to establish contact. As occasion permits, this will take place.</p>
