<p>Approximate costs for the first stage (purchasing an existing liveable vessel, a year's supply of soylent, related electronic equipment, and emergency funds) have been estimated at $20,000, which with frugal saving should be easyl reached within three to five years on a full-time salary where I live. Stage 1 will serve as a research platform for the design of a submersible (as already briefly covered below), and will enable me to focus on self employment and outreach.</p>
<p>For consideration, a quote from 20,000 Leaguse Under the Sea:</p>
<p>["Also," he added, "true existence is there; and I can imagine the foundations of nautical towns, clusters of submarine houses, which, like the Nautilus, would ascend every morning to breathe at the surface of the water, free towns, independent cities. Yet who knows whether some despot——"]<br>
As pointed out by Kingsquee in IRC on 2014 10 22, Andrew Ryan in the game Bioshock is an example of how <em>centralized</em> oceanic cities pose the same problems as isolated enclaves of humanity on land. The threat of despots is always there. Greater decentralization and ease of personal transport addresses this, but that philosophy depends very strongly on being <em>implemented</em> properly. Knowing that Freedom of Transportation is important is one thing, having the vessels and energy to transport yourself are another.</p>

<p>'Boatdev' the nickname for a project to design and build a submersible houseboat, as one measure to address the housing crisis in coastal cities. Existing houseboats are often considered unsightly by the city's wealthier residents, who pressure local governments and law enforcement to disperse the houseboaters. Additionally, mooring/dock-fees are a persistent cost that erodes the inherent savings from purchasing and living on a houseboat. Boatdev aims to address all these issues with a houseboat that can submerge up to 20 feet below the surface.</p>
<p>All current members of boatdev are technologists in the Canadian province of British Columbia. The team can be reached on the Tadeuszow IRC network in the channel '#boatdev'.

<p>Several general designs are under consideration, including a spheroid with an outer framework of rods (for modular extension and greater protection of the home itself, and structural stresses), a conventional cigar submarine (for greater locomotion in the area of residency, ), and a modified steel shipping crate (to reduce cost of construction, and the complexity of intercontinental moving, as trans-oceanic travel is not a planned ability of the first generation of boatdev).</p>
<br>
<p>It is rare for non-state/corporate entities to create and use submersible vehicles, but unheard of, and recent progress in China is very promising:</p>

<p>Others have attempted and failed. It is important to remain sober and bear in mind the numerous risks involved.</p>
<p>Despite the many citizen inventor success stories in China, there exists a language barrier between the members of #boatdev and these Chinese innovators, although we would like to establish contact. As occasion permits, this will take place.</p>
