<p>I've been using Firefox's built-in colour options to customize my browsing for years. I've decided to switch to using the Firefox addon called Stylish, and another called Greasemonkey, both of which I'd only been using as supplements before. First, you need to have Firefox or Chrome installed, and then install the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/?src=external-userstyleshome">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe">Chrome</a> version of the Stylish addon, and then you can install my <a href="https://userstyles.org/users/291977">custom CSS</a>.</p>
<p>Custom Javascript for use with Greasemonkey is forthcoming.</p>
