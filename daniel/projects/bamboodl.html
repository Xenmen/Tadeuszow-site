<p>Bamboodl is a Python script for archiving imageboard threads and art/music. It is still under development and not yet ready for wider release, due to not yet having a graphical interface, but it is already stable for the sites it supports. You can get it over at <a href="https://github.com/Xenmen/Bamboodl">Github</a>. As I improve the code, I will expand and clarify this documentation. Right now, if you're knowledgeable enough to use Bamboodl at all, you probably won't need much coaching. For everybody else though, you may be better off waiting for the graphical edition (which, admittedly, probably won't be until later in 2015).</p>
<p>Currently supported sites are: 8Chan, 4Chan.</p>
<p>Sites for which support is planned but not yet ready: DeviantArt, Newgrounds, Tumblr, Furaffinity, Furaffinity, Inkbunny, Mangafox, Pixiv, and PHPBB based forums.</p>

<p>On first run, bamboodl creates a directory with some configuration files, located at '&lt;user&gt;/.python/bamboodl'. bamboodl.json controls where downloads go, and new.txt is where you put new urls to subscribe to. Your new.txt should look something like this:</p>

<p>Note that having http:// or https:// at the beginning is irrelevent, as is having www, or having a slash (/) at the end of a directory name. Bamboodl uses regex internally to identify valid urls, and all common permutations are handled. Note also that 8Chan html and json links are both acceptable.</p>
