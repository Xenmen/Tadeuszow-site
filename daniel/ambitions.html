			<p >"What's the biggest problem in your field, and why aren't you working on it?"</p>
			<p>(paraphrase of <a href="http://museumtwo.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/what-are-most-important-problems-in-our.html">Nina Simon</a>, in reference to <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">Richard Hamming</a>, <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity">Aaron Swartz</a> also had some thoughts on this )</p>
			<br>
			<p>I've adopted computer science as my field, and there are certainly a lot of large problems to solve. Most pressing are UI/UX inconsistencies that make the lives of developers and users alike a nightmare, legal/technical restrictions on citizens' rights to create, modify, and share information, and compromised hardware that puts the lives and livelihoods of everyone at risk.</p>
			<p>The 1st issue is steadily being addressed by small groups of clever, artistically-minded people around the world [<a href="http://www.pitivi.org/">Pitivi</a>] [<a href="http://elementaryos.org">ElementaryOS</a>] [<a href="https://arkos.io/">ArkOS</a>]. The 2nd and 3rd issues are a combination of legal and technical challenges; the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">FSF</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> are doing excellent work already on the legal matters, though they are strapped for funding. There are some people working on affordable circuit-manufacturing tools, though they are very few in number and have even less funding available.</p>
			<p>There's a common theme here, namely that the biggest obvious problems are already <em>being</em> solved. However, the people solving those problems lack resources. On reflection, I realized I had less value to offer in directly working with these noble groups on solving problems than I did in recognizing and addressing their resource problems.</p>
			<p >Food (and water), housing, and access to computing facilities are the primary needs of these groups. I want to collect all the research already done on the topics of <a href='/projects/autoagro.html'>automated agriculture</a>, affordable housing solutions, and <a href='/projects/libreware.html'>homebrew computers</a>, since these are all closely related issues for the demographic I want to serve (the demographic that is working hardest to serve the rest of the world).</p>
