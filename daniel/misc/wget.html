			<p ><a href="">WGet</a> is a very old, very reliable tool for downloading webpages. I've played around a little with it, and others have played around a lot. I'll share some of the scripts for it later that I've either made or come across.</p>
			<p >Truthfully, wget, while very fast and reliable, is a bit behind in that it doesn't play well with javascript. This is quite understandable if you know the way most Javascript is written these days, and the FSF's stance on Javascript. Personally, for ease of use in scripting, I think WGet ought to be recreated in Python. I suspect this has already been done, though I've yet to check, and am still able to get by with WGet itself.</p>
