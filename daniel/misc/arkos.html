			<p ><a href="https://arkos.io">Arkos</a> is part of the Citizen Web project. Arkos is an operating system with a simple web interface for administration of itself and various installable software packages. Presently, Arkos targets the Beaglebone, Raspi, and a handful of others as listed on its site (though only the Raspi is officially supported as of 2014 July).</p>
			<p >Among the packages listed as of version 0.6.0, I think Wallabag is the most useful. It runs a database where you can store and tag articles you come acrossand would like to record in full. Yes, Wallabag grabs the ENTIRE contents of the article, and best of all, leaves out everything else, such as advertising banners. It also retains the URL to the original article, in the event of later revisions or for proving your copy is accurate (or, perhaps, that the online version has been altered...). Since Wallabag does not store all the HTML of each page, it is not comparable to archive.org for full site backups. Instead, you may want to investigate <a href="wget.html">wget</a>. Wallabag also has an accounts system, so multiple people can use the same Wallabag install and keep separate databases. There is presently no way to share that data between users, or publically. I would like to make my personal collection of aggregated articles public.</p>
			<p>For ease of memory, I recommend you bind Wallabag to <em>port 88</em>.</p>
