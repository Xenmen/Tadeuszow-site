            <br>
            <p>I'm a person interested in solving problem permanently. If you would like to reduce long-term costs in your company, I would be glad to assist you.</p>
            <p>Currently I reside in Burnaby, BC, Canada. I have attended TWU, SFU, and BCIT, and hold several technical certificates (Cisco & Microsoft network administration, Comptia A+, etc). My computing experience is broad, broad enough that I'll have to fill this out later. I'm not sure how to summarize my experiments with Bare Metal OS and LibNDS since certifications don't exist for them, and probably would not be indicative of proficiency anyway.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In any case, this is a living resume and will evolve as I see fit. Presently I do not actually need an online resume, and this is preemptive action to simplify the future. I would rather save money on ink. I don't run my printer often, and printing resumes is a waste when the paper can be so easily damaged and lost.</p>
