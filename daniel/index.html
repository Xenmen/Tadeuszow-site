			<p>This is the homepage of Daniel Tadeuszow, a recently situated resident of Victoria, BC. I hope you find lots of useful information, and sapient art!</p><br>
			<p>Very soon, Daniel will be offering in-home computer servicing in the area, and pricing will be listed on a page linked from here. In the meantime, please consider reading this PDF document from the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, circa 1971, on the topic of computers and education: <a href="http://www.stager.org/articles/twentythings.pdf">http://www.stager.org/articles/twentythings.pdf</a></p><br>
			
			<p>Daniel's background in technology is very varied. At the age of two, Daniel began using the family Atari ST to play a train simulation game. At age 20, Daniel was designing his own Nintendo DS software. In the years between, many experiences with machines and software of all kinds, and in the years since (Daniel is 23 at the time of writing this page), he has focused on web technology almost exclusively. This website is hand-crafted HTML5/Javascript, with the intention of gradually optimizing it. Additional side projects using Unity3D, Python and NodeJS are underway, and tutorials will be available as this software is made available.</p><br>
