			<p>A brain is more than a sack of protein, or a neural net. The information encoded in it makes all the difference in the world. Here I will document information pertaining to good mental health, bad mental health, and for yourself in general.</p>
			<p>Additionally, Daniel recommends you investigate the <a href="nonhumanrights.org">Non-Human Rights</a> project. There is less separating us from the animal world than you probably believe. Remember that it can take only a single generations to decimate a culture. A human locked in a cage, denied liberty and the faculty of its instincts, will behave like any other animal in such conditions. When removed, it will stay culturally dead. To instill culture is a delicate process, one difficult to replicate. Once living memory disappears, it is lost forever. We must take care in preserving the heritage of our planet, and all species within, as only humanity has the capacity to save or destroy it entirely.</p>

			<p>People, like every other discrete object in the universe, have inputs and outputs. Their actions are an insight into the workings of their minds, and if you pay attention, and learn to read those actions, you can better interact with them for a healthy society.</p>
