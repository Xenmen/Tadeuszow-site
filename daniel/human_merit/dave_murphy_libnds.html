			<p>Dave Murphy is the creator of <a href="http://devkitpro.org/">DevkitPro</a>, a toolchain for homebrew Nintendo DS development.</p>
			<p>Dave's actions have saved every independent DS programmer tens of thousands of dollars each, and months of hassling they otherwise would have had to do with Nintendo in order to receive an official devkit, and he has also liberated them from the many heavy restrictions that Nintendo places on the creative and distributive processes.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Additionally, he is a proponent of <a href="http://davejmurphy.com/putting-curiosity-in-perspective/">rational</a> thinking.</p>
			<br>
			<p>For perspective on his personal difficulties, and how projects such as <a href="/projects/autoagro.html">auto-agro</a> would help him, please visit <a href="http://davejmurphy.com/shared-delusions/">this</a> link.</p>
