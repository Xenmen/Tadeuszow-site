<p>You need feeds? You need <em>RSS</em> feeds? Well here they are!</p>
<a href="/feeds/goodmusic.rss">Fresh Music</a>
<a href="/feeds/news.rss">News</a>
<p>Note that although Google Chrome is a modern browser, it does not come with a built-in RSS parser, unlike Firefox. Additionally, many Chrome RSS plugins seem to only display feed titles instead of entire descriptions, which means you won't see the full content of these feeds. I would recommend that you either use a complete RSS solution such as the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/feedbro/mefgmmbdailogpfhfblcnnjfmnpnmdfa?hl=en">Feedbro</a> Chrome plugin, or the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Mozilla Firefox</a> browser instead of Chrome.</p>
<p>If you just really like using Chrome, consider installing the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bbc-radio-tuner/mbhegenoegcelljcidbaalkopfhiddke?hl=en">BBC Radio Tuner</a> for extra news.</p>
