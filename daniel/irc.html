<p>IRC is a useful technology for communicating with people over computer networks. To get started, you should probably join <a href="https://freenode.net/">Freenode</a>, as it is the largest group of IRC servers around, with plenty of knowledgeable and friendly people. On an IRC server, there are channels you can tune in to; other people tuned in to that channel can communicate with each other. You can be in multiple channels at the same time if you wish, and even send private messages to anyone on that server.</p>

<p>To get started with IRC, you can use any web browser, or a dedicated IRC program. The first is fast and takes no technical knowledge. Try the above tool to join a channel that I run on Freenode, or go to <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/">Freenode's webchat</a>, choose a nickname for yourself, and enter the channel "#lesswrong". You *do* need to enter the hash (#). Once you're familiar with IRC, I highly recommend the program <a href="https://hexchat.github.io/">Hexchat</a>, as it has many features that will enhance the experience.</p>
