			<p>Okay, so you want to play an old minecraft modpack from the 1.4.2 days... or 1.6.x... Or maybe much earlier. Well, you can do that with the new launcher, juggling multiple versions without having to cut and paste folders around! It's still a slight pain to setup though. That's what this guide is for, to mark each unintuitive step you need to take. I'll be using Kingsquee's Raidcraft pack as an example.<br>
			1.) Install the new launcher. This should be obvious, but just in-case you want to share this guide with your retarded cousin in Ecuador, this is an official required step.<br>
			2.) In ".minecraft/versions/", note that there are folders for different binary versions of Minecraft. If you use Forge for mods, then the Forge modified version must occupy its own folder. Try installing a new version of forge now if you'd like, and watch what changes here! A new folder will be created, and inside it a jar and json file.<br>
			Create your own subfolder in the 'versions' now, named after your modpack. I now have ".minecraft/versions/1.5.2_Raidcraft/". Inside of that, I put the Raidcraft version of the Minecrat jar (In the modpack, it'll be at ".minecraft/bin/minecraft.jar" or so). You should use the same name the folder has for the jar file, so ".minecraft/versions/1.5.2_Raidcraft/1.5.2_Raidcraft.jar". Next, copy one of the json files from another subfolder, <em>ideally the vanilla version of the minecraft binary your modpack uses (in this case 1.5.2)</em>, paste it here, and rename it to match your subfolder name. I have ".minecraft/versions/1.5.2_Raidcraft/1.5.2_Raidcraft.json".<br>
			So, inside ".minecraft/versions/" I have a folder called "1.5.2_Raidcraft", and inside of it, my old binary for Raidcraft renamed to "1.5.2_Raidcraft.jar", and another file called "1.5.2_Raidcraft.json". You're doing well so far!<br>
			If you are not in fact doing well, please stop following this guide and go see a doctor.
			3.) Assuming you don't have Ebola, open up "1.5.2_Raidcraft.json" in a text editor. Be amazed! There's a lot of stuff in here you couldn't care less about! You'll notice a lot of settings that are specific to the minecrat version, from the folder that you copied this json file from.<br>
			All you need to do is change the 'id' value. Right now I have "1.5.2", so I'm going to change it to "1.5.2_Raidcraft".<br>
			This step is done! Wow, that's the hardest part so far. Go get a lemonade if you're thirsty.<br>
			4.) Once you've had your drink and bathroom break, open ".minecraft/launcher_profiles.json" in your text editor. Notice all that stuff under profiles? Duplicate one of the codeblocks there, and set "lastVersionId" to match the ID you used in the other json file. I'll put "1.5.2_Raidcraft".<br>
