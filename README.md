Tadeuszow.com - 0.1.0
=========
A family website experiment.

Designed to work with Nodejs and the Expressjs library (downloadable via npm). You'll need an up-to-date version of Nodejs, a build at least as recent as 2014 06 xx.

Notes:
* The bash script is designed to spawn node to run in the background, if you want to stop it you'll need to run kill it yourself ("kill node" in the terminal).

Future Features:
* Install script to make running the server a service process that starts on boot, and can be stop/start/restarted in standard fashion.
