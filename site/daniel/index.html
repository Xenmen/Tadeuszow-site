            <p >This is the homepage of Daniel Tadeuszow. He's the fellow who built this site. His personal creed is that no problem is fixed if it will be discussed again tommorrow, next month, or in the next election; a problem is only fixed if it's solved <em>forever</em>.</p>
            <p >Daniel recommends you find local groups of motivated individuals to collaborate with, such as a <a href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_Hacker_Spaces">hackspace</a>, community center, or whatever. If you're bold, just walk onto any university campus, then walk around until you meet some neat people, or find a faculty you're interested in and go into the relevent student society.</p>
