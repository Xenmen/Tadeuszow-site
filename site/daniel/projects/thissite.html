            <p >This website is managed by Daniel Tadeuszow, and built on carefully chosen technologies. The software serving webpages is Nodejs, the webpages are syncronized via Git, written in HTML5, and the sidebar is created with javascript instead of PHP.</p>
            <p ><a href="http://nodejs.org/"><em>Nodejs</em></a> gives the advantage of being extremely extendible and easy to use. Its built in package manager, npm, and use of javascript as a scripting language, enables me to add features with ease. It's small, fast, and a new emerging standard in web technology.</p>
            <p ><a href="http://www.git-scm.com/"><em>Git</em></a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning">versioning tool</a>, with all the relevent benefits that brings. Since I am using <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> specifically, I have the added benefit that everything about the site is very transparent and easily accessible. Any non-technical family member can look at the code to the <a href="https://github.com/Xenmen/Tadeuszow-site">site</a> with a few mouse clicks. It also simplifies the process of having family members directly edit pages themselves. They don't want to use FTP, and neither do I!</p>
            <p ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5"><em>HTML5</em></a> is a choice I don't think needs justification, except that I don't target ancient browsers with the current version of this website. If you want to view it on your dreamcast, there are already tools for that. There are some new capabilities that come with HTML5 as well, which I am anxious to take full advantage of. It's another tool to make the world a better, more interesting place.</p>
            <p ><em>No <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a> is necessary</em>; by having the sidebar and footer inserted by javascript, instead of using PHP or a static site generator, server time isn't wasted on such a trivial process. Plus, I only have to remember one scripting language. That streamlines my security auditing, and is one less thing to install if I do a clean wipe of the server.</p>
            <p >All these technologies add up to make for a very smooth experience in developing, administering, and browsing the site. It scales well too, as nodejs doesn't have to perform any fancy work for each page Request. Theoretically, this system should handle many requests a second (for a small personal site) while not interrupting other private services I run on the server.</p>
            <br>
            <p >The server itself is an old box with 256MB RAM, and is a mere $15/yr in operating costs. You really don't need much financial investment to run a homebrew website! Just time. Hopefully soon, that time cost will also be reduced.</p>
