            <p >"Silicon Quest" is the codename for a project to bring printed circuit fabrication closer to the general public. Digital computation is an extension of human thought, and the means of carrying out that computation are all manufactured and controlled by corporate entities. This situation is not condusive to a free society, and must not be allowed to persist. Information on solving this problem will be posted here as I sort through my past research, as I find more information, and as I acquire and build related equipment myself.</p>
